 @abstract Class used to "manage stack" based on the user's authentication status.
 @discussion This class is created to abstract proper landing page and handling user sign in/sign up results
 appropropriately. It doesn't do any actual user session management or complex navigation stack manipulation, but I
 wanted to abstract this functionality from individual view controllers in case this needs to be expanded on (production
 version of this class would have much more functionality in it.
