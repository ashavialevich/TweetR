/**
 @abstract View Controller used to display sign up screen.
 @discussion This class doesn't perform any email verification, but it performs basic form validation, such as presence
 of the required fields, email field regular expression, also compares password and confirm password fields. Validation
 happens when user clicks submit button. This form should've probably been nested inside UIScrollView to accomodate
 better user experience on short screen and in landscape mode because of the keyboard overlap, but I omitted this part
 as I deemed it not important for the purposes of the coding exercise, if need be I can easily add this functionality.
 As of right not form is optimized for iPhone 6 and + in portrait mode.
